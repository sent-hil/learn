==============================

Motivation, the reason we do an action, is just as important as action that we do.

Mahayna motivation - focus not on our own happiness, but bring happiness to other people and living beings.

Motivation in watching this documentary is to use these teachings not only bring happiness to ourself, but also others around us.

MIND
----

Mind == consciousness. Has no physicality about it. Christians view = soul, materialistic view = brain. Mind == intellect, thoughts, feelings, emotions, conscious, unconscious, instinct etc. No atom of mind created by superior being, ie God, nor parents (stop blaming them!) Body comes from them, not mind. Can't come from nothing. Comes from previous moment of itself, own consciousness, river of mental continnum. Mind is beginning less.

Who am I? What is my purpose? Why am I here? To be Buddha.
Buddha is Sanskirt for to be awake, fully developed consciousness in all positive qualities and free of negative ones. We all posses Buddha nature.

Acron is potential to become an oak tree. You can use it for other things, but that's its true nature.

Mind, which is indestructive, its true nature is potential Buddha. There's no choice or more conditions required for mind to become Buddha. Just like if you plant an acorn and give it right conditions it'll become an oak tree, so will the mind.

This is the attitute we've to develop about ourself. We identity ourself with external characteristics: lazy, fat, tall, human, special, ugly, beautiful etc. We're defining ourself by this small thing.

When you're fully developed Buddha, you'll have infinite emphathy will all living beings, spontaneous desire to benefit everybody. Every living being has potential to know everything, when you remove all pollutions and delusions.

Buddha = omnission + emphathy + omnipotence.

Source of our suffering comes from our mind. There are external condition for suffering, but root cause lies within our mind. The more we understand our own mind is source of our suffering and source of our happiness we being to understand the only way to be free of suffering is free our mind.

We want happiness that is perfect and lasting. There's this amazing phenomenon called mind, not brain, not physical. It is clear, formless and has ability to know. Only thing that knows experiences and feels. 'known' - there are many ways to know. Right now we know things through concept, reading, told by others. This is because our mind is prevented from knowing completely by disturbing thoughts. Without these distractions, then mind can just know. Is it possible to get rid of these disturbing thoughts? It is possible. When we meditate or try to meditate, place the mind on an object, such as our brain, although we're not able to keep it on breath on long time, perfectly, still by putting some effort into doing that, we all experience for some time our disturbing thoughts does reduce. They don't go away completely, but at least they decline. This is an indication, these thoughts have no power on their own to control the mind. Even simple breathing meditation, our mind becomes calmer and clearer because that is its nature state and has tendency to return to it.

You're not limited, hopeless being, under influence of all these things outside and full of suffering. The situation we're in is suffering and we've to die. The solution is pure potential of our mind and we can become this unlimited beings. They call it Buddhas.

Main difference between Mahayana and Hinayana is attitude. Former seeing enlightment for benfit of all others. One can't attain enlightment without practicing tantra. Aside from attitude, practices goes together.

Lamrim - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamrim

3 scopes
Scope - capacity of practioner

1 and 2 - represent Hinayana
3 - Mahayana

First scope
see teacher as spiritul guide
preciousness of life so far, so we don't waste it
impersonance of this person, time is uncertain, only time that can benefit us at time of death is virtues of mind
given there's no beginning or end, it's logical there's possibility of many suffering rebirths mind can take when it leaves body at time of death
turn for refuge to buddha, who gave paths to transform ourself to avoid suffering in future
you do by this practicing karma
we're responsible for our own suffering and happiness

Love is wish others are happy, compassion is wish others don't suffer. Right now we cherish others, because we want that in return. We've compassion based on attachment. We get exhausted and drained at helping others. In our culture, ego is reference point.

MODULE 2 April 20, 11:41pm sun
==============================

What is mediation - disciple where you cultivate a certain amount of familiarity with choosen object. Problem is in day to day life, in unreflective states of mind, generally we're under domination of mind and it's domination of afflictive emotions and thoughts and because of this then it leads to influencing our states of mind on the whole overwhelmed by destructive and negative emotions and thoughts which then perpetuates the whole cycle of problems, confusions, suffering and so on.

What we're seeking in spiritual process is reverse that cycle so gradually in position to take charge of mind to prevent mind coming under domination of negative influences and thoughts. The in which we do this is to engage in constant discipline of familiarity of chosen object so we can gain certain stability of mind where we've the capacity to place our mind and allow it to abide with degree of stability with certain choosen object. Choosen object is positive object towards which we direct our thoughts and then cultive familiarity with it and in this way gradually we'll be able to reverse the cycle. The process of change that takes place within us is gradual.

Two approaches to mediation: analytic and placement.

Capacity to still mind when you want, stop emotions from getting hold you.

Need a calm mind to follow through on thoughts and reach their conclusion.

Instead of constantly going like a yoyo, overly excited when something good happens, depressed when something bad happens. Stable piece of mind is much more pleasant than excitement. What we call pleasure, excitment is actually suffering. It's not real pleasure, like boiling water, no peace or serenity.

We can do this in day to day life, no need to go into isolation.

1. Wishing to do mediation based on its advantage
2. Developing determination to do it for certain amount of time
3. Develop mindfulness of holding object without losing it
4. Use introspection to check quality of concentration, to make it more precise. If you're prone to dullness, hold object more intensely, if too much excitment relax it and slowly you find the middle way and hold onto it.

Stages of meditation
1. Placement of mind : most of the time mind is going all over the place. Time to time you remember supposed to watch the breath.
2. Placement with continunity : able to bring mind on object and stay there for brief moment.
3. Patch like placement : able to stay on object for quite a while, but time to time you lose. But able to bring it back right away.
4. Close placement : from beginning to end, you don't lose object at all. There's distraction and dullness.
5. Controlling : because at last level you're able for whole session, you reach state of inner peace you never experience before. Mind is no longer like boiling water. You experience kind of tranquility you never experience before. There's no gross dullness or excitement, but some still exists.
6. Pacifying : increase in intensity of holding the object.
7. Fully pacified : excitment/dullness doesn't happen often.
8. Single pointed : can reach high levels of concentration wtih only a slight effort.
9. Attentional balance : no effort, sit down and you're able to stay object without any excitment or dullness.
