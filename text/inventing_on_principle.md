# [Inventing on Principle](http://vimeo.com/36579366) by Bret Victor

His principle - creators should be able to see what they are creating, have an immediate connection to their work.

Coding - you type bunch of text into code editor, you compile & run and something comes out.
  No immediate connection between you and the output.
  So much of creation is discovery.

Having an immediate connection allows ideas to surface in way that is not possible before.

Important to the creative process to be able to try ideas as you think of them. If there is any delay in feedback loop, the whole world of ideas will never be.
  Ideas start small, tiny, weak and fragile.
  Ideas need environment where creator can nurture them.
  When there is no immediate feedback, creator can not see what they are doing, ideas end up being born stil/half born.

Binary Search - you have to play computer to write code that does this.
  You have to simulate in your mind what each line of code would do. Good software engineers are good at playing computer.
  But if you are writing code on a computer, why are we simulating code in your brain about what a computer would do?

Fortran/Algo - you type code into bunch of code and come back later for results, no interactivity.
  That assumption is baked into our current notion of what programming is.

C - designed for teletypes. Anytime you use a console or terminal window, it is emulating that.
  Repl is interactive programming b/c that is the best you can do on a teletype.

Millions of ideas locked in millions of head unable to get out because our current tools lack immediate connection.

When ideas die, it feels wrong, a moral injustice, not opportunity, but moral responsibility.
  Not words you usually hear in technical field.
  You do not look at social injustice and say 'Opportunity'.

People throughout history find a cause to fight for, leading an activist lifestyle.
  This lifestyle is not just for social activity.
  Social activists fight by organizing, you can fight by inventing.

Larry Tesler - no modes.
  Softwares were originally designed around modes, i.e. vi.
  Pioneered usage of software usage studies.
  Made personal mission to remove modes.
  "Don't mode me in."
  His self identify is tied to no modes.
  Invented copy, paste.
    Different from Edison invention of phonograph, which he accidentally stumbled upon.
    This invention was in reaction to his no modes philosophy.
  Modes problem only existed in his own mind, for everyone else this is just how computers worked.
    Just like Elizabeth Stanton and universal suffarage. For everyone else back then women not allowed to vote was completely natural.
    Both of them saw a wrong, imagined a world without that wrong and dedicated their lives to fight for that.

Doug Engelbart - invented interactive computing. Putting information on a screen, interacting it with the mouse.

Alan Kay - invented oop, desktop environment.

Richard Stallman - software must be free as in freedom, matter of moral right and wrong.

All above fighting against mainstream that did not recognize a wrong that they saw.

World will try to define you by a skill. That is why you have a major in college, a title. You can spend your life pursuing excellence and practicing a skill, that is the path of the craftsman.
  Entrepreneurship and academia are the other path. You find a problem, you solve it.

Larry Tesler did not follow either way. His problem was not a problem for anyon else.
  He defined himself by his cause.
  Calling him a user experience engineer is like calling Stanton a community organizer.
  He had a vision and brought the world to that vision.

Do a lot of things, make many things, experience a lot of things and use these things to analyze yourself.
  Does this reasonate with me?
  Does this repel me?
  What is the secret ingredient in all these experience that interest me?

It can not be something like "make things simple". Too vague to be directly actionable.
  Defined world as right and wrong in a fairly objective way.
  Looking at person selecting a text: is this person in a mode or not? yes or no?
    If yes, then you have to do something about that.

Creator needs powerful tools vs. creator need immediate connection.
  Looking at person writing a line of code, did they immediately see what the code did? yes or no?
    If no, then you have to do something about that.

There are many way to live your life, many aspects of life involve a choice. You can choice to sleep way through life and accept the default choices.
  But if you find something that is wrong with the world, then you have the choice to do something about that.
